I don't know what to write here aside from gaudy ASCII art, so I guess I'll get that out of the way.

Oh ew gross nevermind I'm just gonna get to the point.

Hi my name is LegoCS aka Russel aka I have four names why am I introducing myself.

B-TLMS is a small patch built to change some things behind the scenes and enhance
the player experience in MM8BDM's TLMS mode.
It's Better Team Last Man Standing...Hence the B.

Changes from 8BDM core [as of v4c]:
- Weapons do no randomize until the countdown phase, allowing people to see weapons.
- Leaf Shield and Junk Shield receive counters when drawn.
- Homing Sniper was moved to slot 4 [close] from slot 2 [ranged] due to it being
    more of a shotgun than a sniper.
- Dive Missile was completely removed from the weapon rotation.
- Thunder Beam can no longer one-shot, this was ported from KD's duel patch.
- Plant Barrier users take more damage with the shield up, also taken from KD's duel patch.
- Alien skin now has a landing sound, taken from the duel patch.

That's...pretty much it. This patch doesn't do much, but the project's goal is to enhance player experience.
Thanks for reading, I guess.
